# Cloud Database

I used Cloud Firestore, a part of Google Firebase as my database. It has a very simple relational database structure, with a User ID attached to every entry.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE
Languages/Frameworks Used:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React


# Future Work

This was just a proof of concept, I look forward to fleshing out the things I've learned here into something working that can be used in something.
